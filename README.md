## Article on Software Development in the FinTech Space

I found this article  insightful: [FinTech and SWE](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/10/10/how-fintech-is-transforming-the-finance-world/#:~:text=Fintech%20is%20bringing%20about%20change,seen%20through%20traditional%20banking%20methods.)

I believe FinTech can change the world. An example of this is how SWE can be used to create a variety of the tools outlined in the article to allow underbanked and unbanked populations to gain access to financial services. One of the main areas that should be focused on is access to credit and how credit scores bar access to housing, loans and overall financial mobility. An example of this is how FinTech can be used in India where farmers do not have access to established and fair loans, they are dependent on loan sharks that keep farmers in perpetual debt. Access to credit, banks, and low-interest loans would change the story of financial mobility for farmers. 

## Comment from Josh Lavroff:

I agree that fintech is a very important field and will continue to become more important in coming years. Not only is it good as a financial tool like you discussed, but it is also good for tech since it drives more jobs and has the potential to create new technology as demand for fintech devs increases. Most big finance companies already have large teams of SWEs and other technical employees, so it is clear that they are taking fintech seriously.
